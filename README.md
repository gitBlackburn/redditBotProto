Tired of people miss spelling your favorite word? 

Does seeing “definitely” spelled incorrectly cause you emotional distress?
Well this app might be for you …

This bot will search a given sub-reddit of your choice and will send a polite message to the user who made the misspelling allowing them 
to correct their transgression.
